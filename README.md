## About

The project is a set of simple program written in Python to solve some games. It was built for the course Computational Intelligence attended at Polytechnic University of Turin.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It is necessary to have a version of Python >= 3.0 and the library Numpy.

## Usage

### Sudoku

To solve some random sudokus run `sudoku/main.py` 

### Connect four

To play connect four with the agent run `connect-four/main.py`. If you want to change the type of agent set the `solver` to a different type. 

## Authors & contributors

The original setup of this repository is by [Daniele Rege Cambrin](https://github.com/DarthReca).

### Sudoku

The sudoku is solved using Algorithm X proposed in _Donald E. Knuth. (2000). Dancing links._

### Connect four

Connect four agent can use [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) or [Monte Carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search).
